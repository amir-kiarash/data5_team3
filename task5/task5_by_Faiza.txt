--2.find the effects of the discount on the low sales region by comparing it with high sales regions discount

For low sales region:

SELECT o.ShipCountry, round(AVG (od.Discount),2) as "discount offered"
FROM Orders o 
JOIN "Order Details" od ON o.OrderID =od.OrderID 
JOIN Products p ON p.ProductID =od.ProductID 
JOIN Categories c ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
GROUP BY o.ShipCountry  
HAVING round(sum(od.unitprice*quantity)) <= 70000


For high sales region 

SELECT o.ShipCountry, round(AVG (od.Discount),2) as "discount offered"
FROM Orders o 
JOIN "Order Details" od ON o.OrderID =od.OrderID 
JOIN Products p ON p.ProductID =od.ProductID 
JOIN Categories c ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
GROUP BY o.ShipCountry  
HAVING round(sum(od.unitprice*quantity)) >= 180000
